# Greatness!
Achieve it! How you ask? Well, it's pretty simple; just use greatness!

## Install greatness
```bash
# Only run this if you don't have rust installed.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Inside the cloned repo
cargo install
```

## What is greatness?
Greatness is you being great and better than everyone else. You have to uphold that superoprity complex don't you?

## How do I achieve greatness?
Simple! Use this tool. This tool is designed to bring your system up to a working state that you like in a small amount of time. It is *very* flexible, 100% modular, and fast.

### But don't use Windows. There are four reasons for this
1. The use case is really small (not many people develop on Windows to the point where you need a dotfile manager).
2. Windows is not great.
3. It's very diferent than MacOS and Unix, where most development happens.
4. I don't have a Windows machine.
Windows support may or may not be added in the future. The underlying code for supporting Windows is added to the best of my ability, but overall it should not work.
