# What is Greatness?
GREAT! Greatness is great! But seriously, what is it?

## What?
Greatness is a dotfile manager. But not just any dotfile manager. It can merge other peoples dotfiles into your own (e.g. you can take your friends bashrc with a single command). It can also bring your new system up with all the programs and commands it needs! It is also fully modular and scripable, meaning that if you wanted to, you could compile custom kernel modules based on the hostname and whether or not the time since the epoc is a multiple of 37.

## Why?
Why did I develop greatness. I wanted something great. More specifically, I wanted something great that could be used to manage your system, deal with dotfiles, and automatically install programs.

## When?
Now.
